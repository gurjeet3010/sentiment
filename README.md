🧠 Sentiment Analysis on Text Data using NLP

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on text input using Natural Language Processing techniques. It classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories using machine learning models trained on labeled datasets.

📘 Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to:

* Preprocess textual data (tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization).
* Train and evaluate a sentiment classification model.
* Predict the sentiment of custom user input.

🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* **NLP Libraries**: NLTK, Scikit-learn
* **Vectorization**: CountVectorizer / TfidfVectorizer
* **Model**: Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes (depending on code implementation)

📁 Project Structure

* `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and sentiment prediction logic.

🔍 Features

* Clean and structured text preprocessing.
* Train/test split and model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix.
* Custom user input interface for real-time sentiment prediction.

🧪 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gurjeet3010/sentiment.git
   cd sentiment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook and run each cell step-by-step:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
   ```

🗃️ Sample Output

```
Input: "I love this product!"
Output: Positive 😊

Input: "It was a terrible experience."
Output: Negative 😠
```

📌 Notes

* The model can be improved further by using deep learning approaches such as LSTM or transformers.
* You can expand the dataset to increase classification accuracy.

🔮 Future Work

* Deploy as a REST API or Web App (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit).
* Integrate BERT-based models for improved performance.
* Add visualization for model insights and prediction confidence.
